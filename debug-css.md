# Some ideas for where to start looking when your CSS is not working
* spelling (of selectors, properties, values, check in html too)
* are you using a class(.) or an id(#)
* what element are you targeting, what selector should you use?
* double check in your html who the parent of your target element is
* should the property be added to the parent or the child element?
* are you following the naming rules for classes and ids?
